# Algorithms & Data Structures in JavaScript

## Introduction
Algorithms & Data Structures(ADS) is an important topic in Software Development world. Create excellent algorithms is a skill which all developers should master and ADS are fundamental to create efficient code. This repository contains implementation of common ADS and the goal of this repository is to help all developers, especially beginners, master ADS.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this repository, it doesn't matter if you are a master in ADS or if you've just started learning to code, every contribution is welcome, feel free to add, refactor or modify anything you think is or will be useful, from a small typo to an algorithm improvement or even a suggestion. If you are a adding something new, please be sure to add it to the right folder.
